            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            n-Way Folder Diff is a simple, platform independent tool to take a 
            diff of multiple folders. It differs from usual diff tools because
            it is possible to do n-way (upto 10 way) diff as compared to the
            usual 2-way diff. As a result, it is possible to see the difference
            between multiple folders at one time. For e.g. finding out the
            difference of files added, changed or deleted in between multiple
            version of a code, with each builder residing in a separate folder.

                        Execute run.bat(Windows)/run.sh(*nix). It must be
                        in the bin folder. On executing it, the application
                        should open up.
