Introduction
-------------
Folder Diff is a simple, platform independent tool to take a diff of multiple
folders. It differs from usual diff tools because it is possible to do n-way
(upto 10 way) diff as compared to the usual 2-way diff. As a result, it is 
possible to see the difference between multiple folders at one time. For e.g.
fiding out the difference of files added, changed or deleted in between 
multiple builds of a code, with each builder residing in a separate folder.

How to use
----------

Execute run.bat. FolderDiff.jar should be in the same folder.

For *nix:
